# Module_9_challenge

## Overview
For this challenge, our goal was to provide an analysis of temperature trends in June and December in Oahu, Hawaii.

This analysis will allow us to best determine if we can expect any major differences in those times of year, what those differences will be, 
and if the 'Surf and Ice Cream Shop' business model is sustainable year round. 

## Results
Our analysis provided the following summary statistics regarding June and December respectively:

December Summary Statistics

This reveals the following important points:

- Most notably, there is not a significant difference between the two seasons. The mean temperature only differs by about 3 degrees, the difference between 71 and 74 degrees in December and June respectively. 
- The minimum temperature, however, is lower in December- meaning that while its still likely that people will buy ice cream on December days that get up to 83 degrees, it may not be as profitable in December. 
- There is also more variation in the temperatures in December, based on the standard deviations. This translates to suggest that business will not be as steady as it is in June. 

## Summary
Overall, this data suggests that this business is feasible to be profitable year round based on temperature alone. Business will likely not be as profitable or busy during the winter, but there still should be opportunities for customers to seek out a convenient combination of Surf Board rental and tasty dairy treats during the colder months. We could also anticipate that busy summer months will make up for winter slumps. 
However, this analysis would be augmented and improved, if we were also able to query wind direction and speed, separately, and use them within our analysis. While temperature affects the comfort of surfing, the wind direction and speed affects the actual wave quality- no one will want to surf on a warm, sunny day if the swell is blown out by high winds coming off the shore- but plenty of dedicated surfers will take to the water on a cold and dreary day if their preferred spot is breaking just so. 
Wind data would allow for a more granular analysis of this business with more consideration to surfers themselves, and their interests. 
This same principle could be applied to tide data in the respective months; wind speed, direction, and tide levels are some of the most important factors to determining the quality of wave at a given surf break. 
Finally, weather data from the pacific ocean far away from Oahu would also allow for us to analyze weather patterns that would lead to better surfing conditions, to better analyze where to locate the surf shop in Oahu, to be nearest to a popular surf location. Although, this would be semi-redundant, as the conditions should still be revealed with the tide and wind queries.
